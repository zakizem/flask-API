`Orientdb <http://www.orientechnologies.com>`_ driver for python that uses the binary protocol.

Pyorient works with orientdb version 1.7 and later.

**Warning** Some issues are experimented with record_create/record_upload and OrientDB < 2.0. These command are strongly discouraged with these versions

**NOTICE** Prior to version 1.4.7 there was a potential SQL injection vulnerability that now is fixed. (see `details <https://github.com/mogui/pyorient/pull/172>`_ )
